Here is a (very) short, interactive quiz designed to test your Javascript knowledge.

This game is designed as a test to Javascript fundamentals using nested timeout and interval functions and recursion. Plan through and beat your own high score, save your initials and try again until you achieve a perfect score for the round.

# Installation 

```
git init
git remote add origin main
git branch -M main
git pull
```
